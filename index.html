                <h4>I am a kind human, who wants to bring happiness to this world. I like to make bold moves in life, 
                    believe that age does not define us, and anyone can change their life around at any point.
                    I am passionate creator. I love to see the tangible outcome of what once was just an idea. 
                    I traveled the world most of my adult life while working for Oceania Cruises and Emirates Airline. Traveling teaches 
                    you life skills including problem solving and quick adaptability.
                    When I was 33 I took MIT open course "Python for beginners" and my heart skipped the bit, I realized that's
                    what I want to do in the next chapter of my life. I got retrenched from Emirates due to pandemic and it gave me 
                    hance to finally realize my dream of being a software developer. I am a dedicated learner and find satisfaction 
                    in development of new skills. Continuous growth and improvement motivates me in life. </h4>
